📘 Akash's Tech Portfolio

Welcome to my technical portfolio! Here, you'll find an overview of my key projects, skills, and contact information. This README showcases my hands-on experience with image segmentation, object detection, and other machine learning techniques.

🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Akash, a passionate Machine Learning Analyst with a strong focus on computer vision, image processing, and data science. My technical expertise lies in building machine learning models and solving real-world problems with innovative approaches. I have worked on projects involving classical image segmentation techniques, object detection using YOLO, and preprocessing large datasets to improve model accuracy.

🚀 Projects

🔍 1. Image Segmentation Using Classical Techniques

In this project, I applied three classical image segmentation techniques to extract objects from images with pixel-level precision. These techniques include:

Thresholding: Converted images into binary format to separate objects from the background.

Edge Detection: Used Canny edge detection to highlight the outlines of objects.

Color-Based Segmentation: Applied the HSV color space to separate regions by color.

🎯 2. Object Detection with YOLO

This project showcases real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework. Key highlights include:

Model: YOLO for fast, real-time object detection.

Tools: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and deep learning frameworks to identify and localize multiple objects in images.
